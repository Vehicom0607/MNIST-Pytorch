# MNIST-Pytorch
A basic NN using pytorch. 

First attempt at just looking stuff up and copy-pasting snippets of code instead of following a tutorial(which i usually find doesn't really encourage learning as much as copying) until it worked

Used ReLU and seemed to address overfitting much better than using a sigmoid non-linearity. Reaches a consistent ~95% classification accuracy.
